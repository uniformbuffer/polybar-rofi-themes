# polybar-rofi-themes

Hi,
i use this repository as a themes backup, but anyone is free to use them.
What i have done is taking themes from https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes and rofi menus from https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi, so if you like them, check out his git, theme and script he made are awesome.
This is not a fork since i'm re-engineering rofi's scripts and integrating them with polybar.
What has been done:
- Integration of theme between polybar and rofi: polybar now pull theme colors from rofi themes (done in this way because there are more rofi themes than polybar themes). I have changed the "change style" script, so that list rofi themes. When a new style is selected, the colors will be applied uniformely also to the polybar.
